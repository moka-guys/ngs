Instructions for setting up CNV analysis using the Moka Pipeline and the R programme ExomeDepth.

OOBed4.py is a python class which will set up customised bedfiles. The script can accept a set of chromosomal regions or a list of transcript accession numbers. You then assign the length to be added either side of your regions of interest and a text bed file will be generated along with a log file indicating what settings were used to generate the bed file

CNVbed.py is a python function which will take the bedfile generated by OOBed4.py and split the regions of interest into regions of approximately 50bp. This is to improve resolution of ExomeDepth when it generates read depth calulations for a region of interest.
